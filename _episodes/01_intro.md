## Welcome

This workshop is aimed at those interested in delivering workshops on programming or computer skills. It will provide a background in pedagogical concepts relevant for the teaching of computational skills, discuss mechanisms for supporting the learning of these skills, provide time to practise relevant teaching styles and strategise for when things don't go to plan. It is provided as part of the University of Exeter Coding for Reproducible Research Initiative. Attending this workshop, does not mean we expect you to deliver on this programme, but is part of a wider effort to expand the capacity of knowledge sharers in this area.


## Learning objectives

By the end of the two sessions, you should be able to 

-	describe the aims of and model behind the Coding for Reproducible Research intiative
-	reflect on the process that novice learners navigate when introduced to a new skillset
-	identify strategies for success when facilitating workshops for novices
-	appraise your own teaching style
- prepare for the unexpected

## Acknowledgements

This workshop has been adapted from the (Carpentries Train the Trainer workshop)[https://carpentries.org/]. The programme and workshops are under constant evolution, your feedback is a core component of this process and we are grateful for your contributions here. 

## Housekeeping

Introduction of workshop leader and helpers.

The workshop in organised into episodes of content, which can be seen in the workshop schedule available on the course website. Our aim is to have an official break every 60-90 mintues, but there will also be periods inbetween deomstrations where you are free to take additional comfort breaks if required. Our aim is to be responsive to the needs of the group, both in person and virtual. Therefore, think of the schedule as a guide rather than a strict timetable. We welcome questions and queries as we go along, so raise your hand if you need assistance.

This workshop will be delivered by alternating short informal presentations and group activities. Your contributions are important to the learning process so we hope there will be high levels of engagement. However, if you are not confident speaking in front of the group, hopefully the group activities will provide a space for you to voice your ideas. With this in mind, we ask that during these interactions everyone is respectful. We allo want to highlight that we have a code of conduct and by attending this workshop you are agreeing to abide by it. 
  
Let's get started.
