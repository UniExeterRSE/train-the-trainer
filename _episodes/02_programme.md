## Coding For Reproducible Research

Our amibtion is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.

Championed by and in partnership with

- Research Software Engineering group
- Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
- Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
- Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
- Quantitative Health Network (QHN) 
- EPSRC Hub for Quantitative Modelling in Healthcare
- Translational Research Exchange @ Exeter (TREE)


## Objectives of the intiative

 To develop and deliver high quality training materials on topics related to coding that enable computational and analytical research to be performed with confidence. 

- Provide a central information point which signposts training opportunities and resources
- Be responsive to the needs of the research eco system
- Catalyse novel research directions through exposure to more advanced techniques
- Open a wide range of career pathways for researchers by upskilling them in transferable skills
- Ensure that the delivery is sustainable in the long term and that individual contributions are recognised
- Facilitate knowledge sharing across the community across institutional, departmental boundaries

## Ethos of the intiative

Inclusive welcoming community who have a passion to exchange knowledge and inspire the development of our colleagues and ourselves.

- Actively work to ensure we are diverse and reflect the student base
- Drawing on existing expertise and provide a mechanism to disseminating that
- Support your own personal development by providing opportunities to progress
- Recognise and reward your contributions
- No minimum contribution â€“ you can just follow our progress
- No minimum expertise 
- Constant review and evolution - value feedback on materials and method of delivery to identify gaps, opportunities or scope for improvement

## What we offer

## Working model

We provide an annual programme of hybrid workshops, open to any staff or student, from any college or department and accessible from any campus. Workshops will be organised in 0.5 day blocks and facilitated by a lead and a number of demonstrators/helpers, including a nominated helper to support the engagement of the remote participants. 

While members of the Research Software Engineering Group will provide a vital resource to enable the delivery of these workshops, we want to capitalise on the existing expertise across research domains and provide oppotunities for them to contribute to these workshops. Ensure we have a broad bases of individuals to deliver these sessions, is a key component of the sustainability of the programme. However, we recognise that everyone is time poor so we need make it as easy as possible for someone to contribute, if they are interested. 

Course materials have been developed by a series of working groups. Each workshop has it's own public GitHub respository such that they can be re-used and evolved as nesesscery. 

We also aim to standardize/automate processes as far as possible including automated preregistration surveys, and feedback surveys.

We are also grateful to Researcher Development & the Doctoral College who are giving us access to their training rooms, as well as handling registration and advertising. 

The final part to ensure that we have adequate capacity to deliver the workshops is to support individuals to be part of our team. Anyone who attends a workshop is in a position to be a helper at a subsequent workshop, anyone who has been a helper at a couple of workshops could become a workshop leader. By creating a sense of community, and providing oppotunities for personal development, we aim to encourage this natural progression.  

To support this we provide this Train the Trainer workshop, as well as monthly community calls, which help ensure the smooth running of the programme.
