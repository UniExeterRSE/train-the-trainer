## Coding For Reproducible Research

Our amibtion is to offer a recurring annual series of workshops open to all staff and students, with opportunities for novices through to more experienced users, to expand their skillsets and position them to confidently perform the informatics research projects in an efficient and reproducible way. A key objective is that the framework we put in place ensures that the workshops delivered are fit for purpose, of a consistent high standard, that delivery is sustainable in the longer term, minimises the workload burden on those who facilitate them and can adapt and expand as new training needs are identified.

Championed by and in partnership with

- Research Software Engineering group
- Institute of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDSAI)
- Researcher Development (Doctoral College and ECRs)
- Reproducibility Network Institutional Leadership team
- Quantitative Health Network (QHN) 
- EPSRC Hub for Quantitative Modelling in Healthcare
- Translational Research Exchange @ Exeter (TREE)


## Objectives of the intiative

 To develop and deliver high quality training materials on topics related to coding that enable computational and analytical research to be performed with confidence. 

- Provide a central information point which signposts training opportunities and resources
- Be responsive to the needs of the research eco system
- Catalyse novel research directions through exposure to more advanced techniques
- Open a wide range of career pathways for researchers by upskilling them in transferable skills
- Ensure that the delivery is sustainable in the long term and that individual contributions are recognised
- Facilitate knowledge sharing across the community across institutional, departmental boundaries

## Ethos of the intiative

Inclusive welcoming community who have a passion to exchange knowledge and inspire the development of our colleagues and ourselves.

- Actively work to ensure we are diverse and reflect the student base
- Drawing on existing expertise and provide a mechanism to disseminating that
- Support your own personal development by providing opportunities to progress
- Recognise and reward your contributions
- No minimum contribution â€“ you can just follow our progress
- No minimum expertise 
- Constant review and evolution - value feedback on materials and method of delivery to identify gaps, opportunities or scope for improvement
