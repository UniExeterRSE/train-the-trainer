## Overview

In this session we will spend some time thinking about how people learn new skills and the stages that you go through as you progress from a beginner to an expert.  

## The stages of learning

We can think of the learning process as a journey through a number of stages. One such model of this process is the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition. 

![Dreyfus model](/fig/skill-level.png)

In the figure above we have simplifed the model to three distinct stages: 

- Novices:
  someone who does not know what they do not know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.
- Competent practitioner: 
  someone who has enough understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal effort under normal circumstances.
- Expert: 
  someone who can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary.

Learners navigate this process through instruction and practise. Our workshops need to combine both these aspects to support participants development.  
If you think about skills you have tried to learn in the past you will probably recognise the different stages. However you should note that the model does not incorporate the learners personal opionions on their ability but focuses on their ability to function.

## Building a mental model

When we learn a new skill we have to connect up the information we are given and gain from practise. Our understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert; rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a subject. This internal representation is often described as a mental model. A mental model allows us to extrapolate, or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”

As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and, most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions” – these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.


A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice, including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous relationships. However, both may be perfectly useful in certain contexts.

Returning to our example levels of skill development:

A novice has a minimal mental model of surface features of the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily from mental models of other domains which seem superficially similar.

A competent practitioner has a mental model that is useful for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong, predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.

An expert has a densely populated and connected mental model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on other features unique to their own mental model.

In the majority of the workshops we will be working with novice learners. We can see from the diagram above that if we are one or two stages ahead of our learners, the way that we think about a problem is likely very different. 

In reality it is probably quite hard to draw a mental map of our personal understanding, even as an expert because some of the connections are so obvious to us, we forget they even need to be explicitly represented. However, when it comes to designing material for workshop, it might be beneficial to consider a concept map, where we try to determine which concepts are the most fundamental to successful learning.  

## Misconceptions in the mental model

As we develop our own personal mental model of a skillset we can introduce erronerous connections. At some point, the addition of new information causes our model to break meaning we need to adjust or evolve the "faulty" connections. This process can negatively affect our learning, as it can take time to readjust to the new model and unlearn the old model. It may force us to reassess all the connections we thought we knew. Depending how long we were using the old model, and the extent of the changes to the model, this might not be a quick process.

### Types of Misconceptions

Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is useful to consider 3 broad categories:

- Simple factual errors:
  These exist in isolation from any deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. 
  Example: believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia.

- Broken models: 
  These occur when inaccuracies explain relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions. 
  Examples: believing that motion and acceleration must always be in the same direction, or that seasons are related to the shape of the earth’s orbit.
  
- Fundamental beliefs:
  These are deeply connected to a learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.
  Examples: “the world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably, also fall into this category of misconception.

The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to watch out for in our workshops. While teaching, we want to expose learners’ broken models so that we can help them begin to deconstruct them and build better ones in their place.

## Tailoring delivery to optimise learning

Now we have considered how learners will process the material we deliver, let's think about mechanisms for optmising the development of effective mental maps.

### Go slow 

One key insight from research on cognitive development is that novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or framework to fit those facts into. In fact, presenting too many facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental model. 

Most learners coming to our workshops are novices, and do not have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our primary goal is not to teach the syntax of a particular programming language, but to help them construct a working mental model so that they have something to attach facts to. In other words, our goal is to teach people how to think about writing a computer programme in a way that will allow them to learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find online.

If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the right categories and make connections among concepts. We do not want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be confusing. An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace at which we teach. Learning consists of more than “just” adding information to mental models; creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as important.

### Using formative assessment to identify misconceptions

In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in their tracks, an Instructor needs to be actively and persistently looking for them. We need to accumulate feedback that allows us to assess the developing mental model of a trainee in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to get this feedback while we teach so that we can respond to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on track. 

This is called formative assessment because it is applied during learning to form the practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical precision, by providing options that capture common misconceptions. 

Formative assessment provides an oppotunity for you to address any misconceptions and adjust your delivery to ensure that learners leave with fit for purpose mental maps. It is preferable to end a workshop with a well strutcured but smaller mental map, than a more complex map with "faulty" connections.
