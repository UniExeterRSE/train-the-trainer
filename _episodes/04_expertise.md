In this episode we will focus on the expert in the room - you! Even if you do not yet think of yourself as an expert, you may nonetheless have advanced to the point where some of these key characteristics – and potential pitfalls – apply to you. We will discuss what distinguishes expertise from novices/competent practitioners, how being an expert can make it more difficult to teach novices, and some tools to help instructors identify and overcome these difficulties.

It is important to recognise that novices will code differently than experts. When presented with a programming task, novices may need to spend time thinking what algorithm they need to implement, whereas expert programmers can often do this on the fly. They may need to break the problem into smaller steps, and then as they implement the steps, debug multiple errors that arise. Debugging can create many set backs for a novice. It requires contrasting what is happening to what should be happening, but a novice might not have sufficient understanding to know what should be happening. 

Novices don't progress into experts by just working through complex tasks slowly. We do not teach reading by taking a classic novel and simply proceeding more slowly. We teach by using shorter books with simpler words and larger print. In programming, we need to adjust to their level and set small, self-contained tasks that they can solve with the tools they have available.  

If we think back to our mental model, we will recall that experts have more connections among pieces of knowledge that help them think and problem-solve quickly; more “short-cuts”, if you will. The greater connectivity of a mental model allows experts to:

- see connections between two topics or ideas that no one else can see
- see a single problem in several different ways
- know how to solve a problem, or “what questions to ask”
- jump directly from a problem to its solution because there is a direct link between the two in their mind. Where a competent practitioner would have to reason “A therefore B therefore C therefore F”, the expert can go from A to F in a single step (“A therefore F”).

Let's explore how this might affect how you teach.

### Expert awareness gap

Because your learners’ mental models will likely be less densely connected than your own, a conclusion that seems obvious to you will not seem that way to your learners. It is important to explain what you are doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one. The problem with this is that when you are used to going from A to F in a single leap, it can be very hard to remember that novices need to go through steps B and C before they can understand the connection between A and F. Experts are frequently so familiar with their subject that they can no longer imagine what it is like to not understand the world that way. This phenomenon is known in the literature as an *expert blind spot*, although some prefer the more inclusive terminology the *expert awareness gap*. For this reason, not being too much of an expert can in fact be a benefit when teaching novices.

### Switching Language 

If you worked in the USA in the same building as something called a “delicatessen”, you might invite a friend to meet you at “the deli” or simply at “the restaurant” and expect them to know what you mean, because you naturally use these terms interchangeably. Yet, someone less familiar with US English might hesitate, wondering if these words mean the same thing, or close enough, under the circumstances. Similarly, in a Carpentries workshop, an Instructor may start a workshop talking about “Unix,” but then automatically start using words like “bash” and “shell” without noticing that learners are struggling to figure out how these two new words are related.

Novice learners can be confused by interchangeable use of more than just vocabulary. In programming, multiple forms of notation may be used to reference a column in a data frame, for example, with the same effect. Instructors may use absolute file paths in one place, then default to relative file paths elsewhere without noticing that explanation is required. Or, they may assume that a learner who has an absolute file path will be able to navigate to the file in a GUI.

Building awareness of how you can represent the same concept in multiple different ways will help you avoid doing so without explanation while teaching.

### What Problem?

Experts are also better at diagnosing errors than novices or competent practitioners. If faced with an error message while teaching, an expert will often automatically diagnose and solve a problem before a novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it is very important while teaching to be explicit about the process you are using to engage with errors, even if they seem trivial to you, as they often will.

### Advantages of being an expert

As we have seen, the high connectivity of an expert’s mental model poses challenges while teaching novices. However, that is not to say that experts cannot be great teachers! Because of their well-connected knowledge, self-aware experts are well-poised to help students make meaningful connections, to confidently turn an error into a learning opportunity, or to explain a complex topic in multiple ways. Experts can be highly effective as long as they learn to identify and correct for their own expert awareness gaps.
