We strongly recommend delivering material to beginners by "live coding". Live coding is where the workshop lead has their screen projected to the learners and works through the lesson typing in the code, explaining it as they go. However, the instructor is not live coding in a vacuum. Importantly, learners are strongly encouraged to “code-along” with the instructor.

> List some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding from both a learner’s and an instructor’s point of view.


Live coding providing learners with continuous opportunities for practice (every time they type in a line of code) and continuous feedback (their code either works or fails with an error message). It is important to keep in mind, however, that feedback is not helpful if you cannot understand it. Many error messages are obscure and not written with novices in mind. However, these errors, present oppotunities for learning if they are explained carefully. 

## Top Ten Tips for Participatory Live Coding in a Workshop

1. **Stand up and move around the room if possible.** This makes the experience more interactive and less monotonous. Use a microphone if one is available to make it easier for people with hearing difficulties to hear you.
2. **Go slowly.** For every command you type, every word of code you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out loud what you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This slows you down and allows learners to copy what you do, or to catch up. Do not copy-paste code.
3. **Mirror your learners’ environment.** Try to create an environment that is as similar as possible to what your learners have to reduce cognitive load. Avoid using keyboard shortcuts.
4. **Use your screen wisely.* Use a big font, and maximize the window. A black font on a white background works better than a light font on a dark background. When the bottom of the projector screen is at the same height, or below, the heads of the learners, people in the back will not be able to see the lower parts. Draw up the bottom of your window(s) to compensate. Pay attention to the lighting (not too dark, no lights directly on/above the presenter’s screen) and if needed, re-position the tables so all learners can see the screen, and helpers can easily reach all learners.
5. **Use illustrations to help learners understand and organize the material.** You can also generate the illustrations on the board as you progress through the material. This allows you to build up diagrams, making them increasingly complex in parallel with the material you are teaching. It helps learners understand the material, makes for a more lively workshop and gathers the learners’ attention to you as well.
6. **Turn off notifications on your laptop and phone.**
7. **Stick to the lesson material.** The core Carpentries lessons are developed collaboratively by many instructors and tried and tested at many workshops. This means they are very streamlined - which is great when you start teaching them for the first time. It may be tempting to deviate from the material because you would like to show a neat trick, or demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Do not do this, since there is a fair chance you will run into something unexpected that you then have to explain. If you really want to use something outside of the material, try it out thoroughly before the workshop: run through the lesson as you would during the actual teaching and test the effect of your modification. Some instructors use printouts of the lesson material during teaching. Others use a second device (tablet or laptop) when teaching, on which they can view their notes and the Etherpad session. This seems to be more reliable than displaying one virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.
8. **Leave no learner behind.** You will learn later in the workshop how sticky notes can be used to gauge learners’ progress and understanding.
9. **Embrace mistakes.** No matter how well prepared you are, you will make mistakes. This is OK! Use these opportunities to do error framing and to help your learners learn the art of troubleshooting.
10. **Have fun!** It is OK to use humor and improvisation to liven up the workshop. This becomes easier when you are more familiar with the material, and more relaxed. Start small, even just saying ‘that was fun’ after something worked well is a good start.


> #### Group activity
>
> Split into groups of three.
> Assign roles, which will rotate: presenter, timekeeper, note-taker.
> Have each group member teach 3 minutes of your chosen lesson episode using live coding. For this exercise, your peers will not “code-along.” 
> Before you begin, briefly describe what you will be teaching and what has been learned previously. Do not record this exercise.
> After each person finishes, each group member should share feedback (starting with themselves) aim for one piece of negative and one piece of positive feedback each for content and delivery. The timekeeper should keep feedback discussion to about 1 minute per person; this may leave some time at the end for general discussion. 
> Change over roles, and repeat until everyone has had a practise of live coding.
