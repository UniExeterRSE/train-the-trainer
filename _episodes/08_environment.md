There are many teaching practices that can make your workshop more positive and welcoming. However, no workshop occurs in a vacuum: everyone’s experiences begin and end and are influenced by the world beyond. Here, we will discuss some of the systemic barriers that can result in members of some groups being excluded even in an otherwise welcoming environment. The fact that some groups face barriers that others do not means we cannot take a one size fits all approach to creating a positive learning environment.There are also elements we need to be concious of to avoid inadvertently make some learners feel marginalised.

## The ethos of our workshops

One of our core commitments is be an inclusive welcoming community. However, just by being open to all, does not mean that our membership in terms of instructors and learners will naturally be welcmonig to all. There may be a number of systemic barriers that exist that we may or not be aware of that cause some groups to still be reluctant to join us. Therefore we need to be active in addressing these and establishing a positive framework to minimse these hurdles.

To set this framework we have a code of conduct. 

#### Code of Conduct

These courses have been developed by a team of volunteers and are under continual review to ensure that they are fit for purpose. The delivery of these workshops is often performed at the margins of an individuals official job description, please be considerate of this when communicating with the workshop leaders and helpers.

Our ethos is to provide a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By registring to attend one of these workshops, participants are agreeing to abide by the Researcher Development Code of Conduct.

Our goal is to support you to develop your programming skill sets to enable you to do cutting edge research. We want to create a positive and professional learning environment and therefore encourage the following kinds of behaviours:

Show courtesy and respect towards all who attend a workshop or engage in community events

Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences

Gracefully accept constructive criticism

Be patient if there are technical glitchs. While we know something about how to use computers we are not immune to internet or hardware issues.

Thank you for taking the time to read our Code of Conduct. We look forward to welcoming you on to our courses.


It is designed to protect and support both learners and instructors. While it may seem obvious to many, highlighting the code of conduct at the beginning of each session and upholding it's values is an important standard to meet.

## Systemic Exclusion

As Instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within our control or influence. However, the world is a complicated place, and there will always be extraneous factors that contribute to demotivation and add to cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but members of certain groups often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that disproportionately impact them. What we can control, in this case, is our own awareness of the challenges these forces present to teaching and learning. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also think carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our learners to avoid reinforcing systemic bias.

#### Stereotypes

We all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive purpose. One study suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information every day. That is more information than we could ever process, so our brains use shortcuts. What an expert thing to do! Stereotypes are one of those shortcuts. As with other models, they are all wrong… but some are dangerous.

#### What are stereotypes?

Stereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in which a set of characteristics is associted with members of a group. Sterotypes:

* may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious and automatic)
* guide what we notice about people
* guide how we interpret people’s behaviors
* can facilitate quick judgements in appropriate situations (e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)
* can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards members of certain groups

Stereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit, but they are especially hazardous when they are implicit. This means that the people holding them may not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are guided by them.

When Instructors have stereotypes about learners, this may lead them to:

* call attention to differences unnecessarily
* give more or less attention to certain learners
* respond to questions differently for certain learners

When learners experience stereotypes about themselves, they may:

* develop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability
* experience increased cognitive load when reminded about a stereotype, interfering with the learning process. This is known as stereotype threat.

The key here is to identify any sterotypes you may hold, and be aware of how it influences your teaching and interactions. Bring it into your conciousness, decreases the negative effects it may have.



## Guidance for creating a positive enviroment in a workshop setting

### Set the stage

Before the session, take a step back to consider the big picture. How will learners perceive your classroom environment? 

> **Group activity**
>
> How do you want to be perceived by your learners (or even your co-instructors)?
> What you do think is important/beneficial to share with your learners prior to starting the workshop?
>

Some things to consider

* **Your attire.** This is one of those things that “should not matter” but, in reality, clothing has a powerful influence on perceptions of everything from credibility to kindness. Be comfortable, be intentional, and convey what you want to communicate. (Also, check the weather, and make no assumptions about thermostats in an unfamiliar classroom!)

* **The physical environment.** Are you in a small classroom or a large, impersonal lecture hall? How are the seats arranged? Physical features may be beyond your control, but they still contribute to your learner’s impressions. How can you help? (Note: if you are in an online environment, structural features can also impact your workshop experience! What are those features, and how can you modify or moderate their impact?) If you are unfamiliar with the environment, give yourself an aoppotunity to suss it out either in adavnce or arrive early enough to work out how to use the equipment.

* **Your use of the few minutes before class.** Is the instructional team present and welcoming, or rushing in frantically to a waiting crowd? Given the heavy use of technology in teh delivery of these sessions, it is really prudent to allow enough time to set this up and test it if possible. 

### Launch the workshop on the right foot

Take a moment to think back to a course or workshop you really liked, think about how it began. Your impression on the first day of a course probably matched that of the rest of the course. It also probably stands out in your memory far more than the rest of the course! This is due to a feature of memory known as the primacy effect. Opening experiences make a difference in the short and long term – introductions set the tone for the workshop and the path for learning.

A strong introduction sets the tone for your workshop, teaches learners how to engage, and inspires confidence that learners will get what they need. 
Introducing a workshop is an exciting and empowering moment! It can also be intimidating. Having a plan helps relieve stress and get you started. Even in the face of early technical issues (which is common at the start of a workshop), you can have a chance to reset with something you are comfortable and ready for.

#### Introduce the workshop

Check everyone is in the correct place!

#### Introduce the instructional team

Tell the learner a bit about who you are and your background (and experience if you like) and allow the rest of the team to introduce themselves. Get the learners to see you as an individual rather than a stereotypical teacher. This can be really helpful if you are anxious about delivery to break down barriers between the learners and yourself and create a more collegiate atmosphere. If your instructional team has distinct roles in the workshop (e.g. "notetaker" vs "roaming helper", be sure to introduce them, too. Some things to consider including in your introduction: 

* your experience or related areas of work
* how formal/informal you want to be
* how available you will be to the learners
* your enthusiasm for the subject
* your motivations for teaching

#### Setting expectations

Clearly establishing expectations at the outset orients learners to participate actively and helps them use their time productively. Keep in mind that critical information will need to be communicated more than once! This information should also be present in your workshop documentation.

* Describe the prerequisites (if any).

* Share the schedule and logistics. Post lunch and break times, and stick to them! Share bathroom & lactation room locations and any other instructions specific to your workshop. Demonstrating a commitment to accessibility at this point will help learners feel more comfortable making additional requests as needed.

* Communicate the workshop structure, including learning objectives and hands-on approach. 

* Communicate your expectations for learners, including:

    - how to follow the Code of Conduct
    - ways to ask for help
    - ways to give feedback to the instructional team
    - Collect and share baseline data on learners. Sharing and discussing these data with learners can help to combat imposter syndrome and let them know that they are welcome ‘as they are’.
    - 
* Your doubts. Sometimes if you have doubts about how the workshop will go, either because you are new to teaching or because you are aware of potential problems, this may come across (intentionally or unintentionally) during your introduction. Sharing such vulnerabilities judiciously can help keep learners on your side when problems do arise. However, there is also a risk of undermining learner confidence. Thinking this through in advance can keep you from oversharing in a moment of anxiety!

#### Initiate their growth mindset

Share some advice for success – including your confidence that they can do it! If you have a range of skill backgrounds, this is a good opportunity to offer differentiated advice on how to make the most of the experience, e.g. suggesting that intermediate learners build their skills by helping a neighbour or considering more advanced questions to be discussed during the breaks.

#### Whet learners’ appetites for workshop content

In most cases, your learners chose to attend this workshop, but they may yet be unclear on whether it will be worthwhile. This is a great chance to get them excited about the prospect of learning what you have to teach!

#### Encourage the classroom community. 

Becoming familiar with other participants helps learners relax and engage, breaking down fear and supporting a sense of belonging. Icebreakers can seem silly and they do take time, but even a lightweight activity makes a big difference. This also sets the tone for an active workshop, which can be especially important if your curriculum does not offer early opportunities for interaction.

### Listening with Assessment and Feedback

Motivating practices like those discussed in the previously to invite participation and encourage a growth mindset can also contribute to making a classroom more inclusive for diverse learners. However, we cannot assume that any instructional approach has succeeded at fostering inclusion if we do not listen to our audience. Explicitly seeking to learn from and attend to the concerns of your learners is key. If you find yourself feeling uncertain about whether you are successfully including all learners, this is a good time to pause and create an opportunity to listen.

When you are actively providing avenues for feedback, there are two signs of trouble to watch out for: negative feedback, and a lack of feedback. If an environment does not feel inclusive, many learners will not feel comfortable reporting this; indeed, they may not recognize it themselves. It can be difficult to notice the people you are not hearing from in a room! When in doubt, communicate with your team and work together to identify and (gently) check in with anyone you haven’t heard from. In addition, examine your feedback processes to be sure you are including opportunities for anonymous feedback.

## Finish on a high note

A solid conclusion helps learners to solidify what they have learned and plan their next steps, and sends the everyone – including Instructors and Helpers – home with a sense of accomplishment. Your workshop almost certainly had some highs and lows. If you followed our advice about going slowly, it is also likely that you will be pressed for time at the end! Out of respect for all involved, it is important that you end your workshop on time. Even if you have not met your content goals, there are far more valuable ways to spend the last 15-20 minutes of a course than squeezing in one last command or bit of advice.

* **Close and save files.** Where can those files be found, and how can learners pick up independently where you left off?
* **Reflect on learning.** This can help learners to solidify key concepts they have learned, making them easier to remember. It may also flush out a few last questions.
* **Plan next steps.** Does the local community have resources to support continued learning? Do you have advice for how learners might continue on their own? Even if you have no advice, asking learners to take a moment to discuss their own plans can support them in taking a next step sooner rather than later.
Reiterate where the lesson materials can be found, and encourage them to apply at least one of the skills to their own work within the next few days. 
* **Collect feedback.** Minute cards, one-up-one-down, and making time for post-assessment surveys will support your continuing development as an Instructor as well as our continuing development of our workshops. This can also support or complement a reflection activity.
* **Celebrate everyone’s hard work.** Thank your learners for helping each other, for staying motivated and persevering with you! Thank your helpers – keep a list of names handy if you might forget them. Enjoy the applause, and give everyone a moment to bask in praise for a job well done.

### Managing a hybrid environment

As a result of the pandemic we have all had to adjust to remote working. Now we are all starting to return to the office, but not in the way we were before. Hybrid working environments are now the norm. While there can be a lot of negativity surrounding the challenges, by embracing the potential we can actually resolve some of the accessibility challenges we had before. 

We cannot ignore the challenges, and we cannot be ignorent to the fact that the breif for the workshop environment has evolved. It is not enough to run an in-person workshop and provide a link for people at home to watch along and join in. We need to be proactive in ensuring an equitable experience as far as possible. 

> ** Group activity **
>
> Think of a remote or hybrid workshop you attended. What went well and what went less well. 
> 

Some of the challenges to negate

* Technical issues and additional set up tasks.
* Encouraging remote participants to engage actively.
* The option of joining remotely can negatively influence the number of people in the room.
* Last minute attendees want to switch attendance method.
* Attending a remote session, seems less personal and potential for higher levels of non-attendance.

Some possible solutions. 

* Test the systems out in advance or use facilities/tools you are comfortable with. Share some of the set up load with you co-instructional team.
* Check in with the participants prior to the workshop, reminding them that they will be expected to engage. Providing the expectations in advance can help focus the attention.
* Have helpers dedicated to participants in the room and those online.
* Make a level playing field - discourage use of the chat function, instead provide a collaborative document or question app that all learners can contribute to.
* Provide a written narrative of content to online participants in case of issues with audio or connection strength
* Consider putting the remote participants into a() breakout room(s) during activities with a helper.
* Log into the Teams call early, so you are ready to welcome the remote participants. If you are unable to man the call - post a message in the chat to let them know they are in the right place and you will be with them shortly. 
* Encourage virtual participants to turn their cameras on. Research has shown that if meeting attendees log on and they see everyone else has their camera on, they will turn theirs on as well. In contrast if they log on and see no one has there cameras on they are lkely to keep theres off. Essentially to encourage you need to ensure that when the first participant logs in there is someone there with their camera on. This can be the helper assigned to look after the remote participants.
* Use an interactive icebreaker activity that both in person and remote participants can engage with.
* Breakdown pre course data by attendence mode to create some community within in person and remote participants. Note this should only be considered if there are adequate numbers to enable attendees to remain anonymous.  
* Let the people in the room know there are people connected remotely, either by displaying them on the screen. They can then help you identify if someone is trying to speak.
