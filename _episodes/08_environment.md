Provide an introduction to the 

Clearly establishing expectations at the outset orients learners to participate actively and helps them use their time productively. Keep in mind that critical information will need to be communicated more than once! This information should also be present in your workshop documentation and/or collaborative notes.

Describe the prerequisites (if any).

Share the schedule and logistics. Post lunch and break times, and stick to them! Share bathroom & lactation room locations and any other instructions specific to your workshop. Demonstrating a commitment to accessibility at this point will help learners feel more comfortable making additional requests as needed.

Communicate the workshop structure, including learning objectives and hands-on approach. If your instructional team has distinct roles in the workshop (e.g. “notetaker” vs “roaming helper”, be sure to introduce them, too.

Communicate your expectations for learners, including:

how to follow the Code of Conduct
ways to ask for help
ways to give feedback to the instructional team
Collect and share baseline data on learners. If you are teaching an official Carpentries workshop, you should have received the results of your pre-assessment surveys – these can be helpful in planning your workshop! Even so, you may have additional questions, and there will always be learners who did not fill out the survey. Sharing and discussing these data with learners can help to combat imposter syndrome and let them know that they are welcome ‘as they are’.

Share some advice for success – including your confidence that they can do it! If you have a range of skill backgrounds, this is a good opportunity to offer differentiated advice on how to make the most of the experience, e.g. suggesting that intermediate learners build their skills by helping a neighbour or considering more advanced questions to be discussed during the breaks.

Whet learners’ appetites for workshop content. In most cases, your learners chose to attend this workshop, but they may yet be unclear on whether it will be worthwhile. This is a great chance to get them excited about the prospect of learning what you have to teach!

## Managing a hybrid environment

Make a level playing field - discourage use of the chat function, instead provide a collaborative document or question app that all learners can contribute to.

Written narrative of content to online participants in case of issues with audio or connection strength

Consider putting the remote participants into a breakout room during activities with the relevant helper.

Encourage virtual participants to turn there cameras on. Research has shown that if meeting attendees log on and they see everyone else has their camera on, they will turn theirs on as well. In contrast if they log on and see no one has there cameras on they are lkely to keep theres off. Essentially to encourage you need to ensure that when the first participant logs in there is someone there with their camera on. This can be the helper assigned to look after the remote participants. 

Log into the Teams call early, so you are ready to welcome the remote participants. If you are able to man the call - post a message in the chat to let them know they are in the right place and you will be with them shortly. 



Let the people in the room know there are people connected remotely, either by displaying them on the screen. They can then help you identify if someone is trying to speak.
