Teaching is a skill - and a complex one at that. You may be new to teaching or have a long list of previous experience. We have previously covered how being an expert does not nessecary translate to being an effective teacher. Building and developing your teaching skill takes time, effort, and deliberate practice. Here, we will discuss strategies about how to prepare yourself for success in the classroom.

## Reviewing the content

Carefully reviewing the content of your workshop in advance is important. However, it is common for new Instructors to over-prepare on technical content – which can be endless! – and under-prepare the learner-centered elements of their teaching practice. If you encounter questions that you can’t answer, demonstrating how you Google things may earn surprisingly positive feedback! In contrast, neglecting to attend to the audience usually has much more serious consequences for learning and morale. When you prepare to teach, we therefore suggest setting aside time before deeply reviewing your technical content to plan your approach to instruction.

## Anticipate the audience

To teach effectively, you have to know who you are teaching. You may have a broad idea about the type of audience you expect. You may even plan a few ice breaker activities to learn things about your participants at the beggining of a workshop. However, in thinking about your learners, it is also important to consider the broader contexts they represent. The beginner that you know best is yourself when you started out on your journey to learn how to programme. It can be a helpful process to reflect on your own journey as a learner, and think about what you found helpful or hindered your progress. However, there are many reasons why your personal experience might not be a typical experience or appliable to the majority of learners. Identifing how learner's experiences and needs may be similar to or different from your own, or from each other can be very important to ensuring your methods are accessible to all.

As you strive to anticipate your audience, it is useful to recognize that you will never know everything about the whole people who come into your classroom. You will not be informed about their hopes and fears beyond what they choose to present. You will never know the full spectrum of neurodiversity represented in your workshop. You will not know who is going through a rough break-up, who struggles with an abusive work environment, who has a sick baby at home, or who skipped breakfast to save money that morning. What challenges might affect your imaginary person? Thinking deeply about learners as people can help you prepare to bring your best self and provide an inclusive environment for everyone.

One tool we provide here to help you anticipate your audience is a pre-workshop questionnaire. This is designed to capture some insights into your learner's prior programming knowledge, their academic backgrounds and their personal motivation for attending the workshop. 

## Focus on the learning objectives

As we discussed previously our objective is to support our learners to develop a appropriate mental map and void over burdening them with facts they are unable to process. Each workshop whould be structured around a series of learning objectives, which should be quite specific about what a learner should be able to do by the end of the episode. For beginners, they should be based on simple actions (e.g. "recognize", "distinguish" or "use" ) and be "testable". Having these in mind when you are teaching can help you remain focused. You can also then identify oppotunities for formative assessment that help you confirm that our learers are building accurate mental models.

When experts teach, they are often eager to advance their learners to higher cognitive levels where challenges seem more interesting or valuable. While the learning objectives in your beginners lesson might seem a bit dull or simple to you, you can understand the appeal! And the goal is laudable. However, teaching is an incremental process, and giving in to this urge can result in skipping steps (see “expert awareness gap”), leaving novice learners in a state of cognitive overload. ‘Higher order’ tasks like synthesis or creation rely on more fundamental levels of understanding, and are therefore prone to failure when applied too soon. Awareness of exactly what underlying knowledge is required at each step will help you to avoid asking too much. 

## Consider the use of formative assessments

The purpose of learning objectives is that they are measurable. When a learner acheives the objective, both the learner and teacher should be able to identify that. It  is highly valuable to both the learner and teacher to be able to track when learning objetives are met. For learners it serves as motivation and for teachers it is very rewarding and satisfying. Adding in regular check points, aligned to the learning objectives, builds yours and your learners confidence.

It is recommended to use a formative assessment frequently, ideally every 5 minutes and at least every 10-15 minutes in order to make sure that the class is actually learning. Since the average attention span is usually only this long, formative assessments also help break up instructional time and re-focus attention. Formative assessments can also be used preemptively: if you start a class with a question and everyone can answer it correctly, then you can safely skip the part of the lecture in which you were going to explain something that your learners already know.

### "Do You Understand?" is ineffective as a formative assessment

Learners are often reluctant to admit when they do not understand. Furthermore, self-assessments of skill in the absence of formative assessment are often inaccurate because of the Dunning-Kruger effect: the less people know about a subject, the less accurate their estimate of their knowledge is. Therefore, if you ask a room full of people "Do you understand?" the result will invariably be a number of ‘yes’ responses (many of them inaccurate) which tend to drown out a variable amount of silence. Instead, a targeted formative assessment takes the inaccuracy and stress of self-judgement away and demonstrates to all whether the learners’ level of understanding has met the instructor’s goal.

## Review prior feedback

If the workshop you are tecahcing has been delivered before, either by yourself or someone else, there should be some feedback that you can review. Hopefully any major issues to do with content will have been adjusted but there might be some delivery related suggestions that you can incorporate. If you ran the workshop yourself, this will help refresh your memory of all that went well (yay!) as well as challenges you faced and learners who struggled at certain points. Just a few moments of reflective practice with prior feedback will go a long way towards building your skill as a teacher and making each workshop you teach better than the last. Even if someone else ran the workshop, there may be insights into common sticking points that you can avoid. 

## Contact your team

It is always preferable to teach in a team. We recommend that workshops are facilitated with a workshop lead and workshop helpers. Introducing the team to each other before hand is advisable as well as ensuring everyone is aware of their specific roles. If you have taught the workshop together before then there is also the oppotunity for collective feedback. 

## Preparing for the unexpected

We've put in all this effort to prepare our for delivering our workshop, we are motivated to be an effective teacher and implement what we have learnt. However, out of nowhere something we could never have predicted throws us. We feel ourselves losing our cool, and are desparate to get back on track for fear that it might neatively affect our reputation as either a teacher or expert in the area (or even both). Teaching is not the only activity where the fear of something going wrong can negatively affect our cofidence or willingnees to complese that task. Here we are going to allow ourselves to catastrophise. We are also going to take advanatge of the fact that here are are not in fact up at the front of the clas with the pressure that brings and use our collective experience and problem solving abilties to strategise potential solutions. 

> **Group activity**
> 
> In small groups, discuss the teaching scenarios that you fear disrupting your workshop. How realistic are they? How catastrophic would they be? 
> We will collate these scenarioes into a master list at the end of the activity.
>


> **Group activity**
> 
> In small groups, come up with some solutions to some of the proposed disruptive scenarios. 
> Are there any for which you really are unsure how you would handle?
> 

Hopefully for most of the scenarios, given the chance to trouble shoot away from the pressure pot of the classroom, you or someone in the wider came up with some solutions. Most learners are reasonable human beings and will be understanding when somthing out of your control/unpredictable happens. Most of them may be teachers themselves and have some sympathy with your situation. Below we will list some common solutions.

* **Expectation management - our own** Often it is the pressure we put on ourselves to be the perfect teacher that we are afraid to disprove. Reminding ourselves that our teaching skill (and workshop content) is continually evolving subject to practice and feedback. We should never get complacent it. Reframing tecahing as just more practice of the skill we are developing, should help remove the urge to be perfect.   

* **Expectation management - of the learners** As we stand at the front of the class we feel we are there to represent the expert in the topic of the workshop. Remember all that we discussed about how being expert does not nessecarily mean you are going to be an effective teacher. The learners are far more interested in your ability to share your knowledge than the extent of your knowledge. Realistically you only need to be a few steps ahead of them to be able to lead a session. However if teaching is new to you, or the workshop you are delivering is new to you, set the right tone for the session by acknowledging this.  

* **One student or a couple of students are determining the speed of the lesson** There are a number of scenarioes where one up to handful of students are requiring a fair bit of attention, leading you to feel guilty about the majority sitting around waiting idly while simultaneously feeling guilty about deciding to move on. Maybe they have had a technical failure or maybe they are asking a lot of questions, or maybe they are taking longer on the activities.It is important here to draw on the team of instructors and helpers who should be vigilant for learners who are falling behind and intervene early so that they do not become frustrated and give up. Another resource you can draw on is the other learners, On option is to encourage learners to help others nearby when they feel comfortable doing so. Teaching is a great way to level up learning. Note that you will need an icebreaker before most learners will take this advice. An alternative  option here is to get the learners to work in pairs.
